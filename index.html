                    <h2>Three years ago…</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The scene is set. A PTA curry and quiz night in a school hall in Battle. A bearded man waits in nervous anticipation for the hot young languages teacher from room 53 to join the team—his first chance at something more than the fleeting exchange of small-talk while he refills the printer, or turns her computer off and on again.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="italic">Why is she late?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ten minutes later, the team is complete and the quiz is in full-flow.  They laugh together, share anecdotes: she gives him a beer—he is in love. He realises his second-guessing of the team’s perfectly reasonable answers has caused more harm than good. She finds this endearing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="italic">Is there something there between them?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As they put chairs and tables away at the end of the evening, he asks if he could add her on Facebook. She chuckles, “of course you can.”</p>

                    <h2>Five whole months later…</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Why has it taken this long to find out he's single? Why did nobody tell her?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="italic">Thanks Barnes!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Taking out her frustration on the pastry she's making in her tiny house in Battle, she finds herself unable to keep her thoughts from wandering to the upcoming pub quiz – or, more to the point, to the thought of that sexy man joining her on the team.</p>
                    <br>    
                    <p>Still a whole week away though; basically an eternity. Why did she not ask him for his number? … but he IS on Facebook! </p>
                    <br>    
                    <p>Unable to contain herself any longer, she opens her laptop and scrolls to find Lee’s profile. Keyboard now covered in pastry, she types the message: “HAPPY WEEKEND!” and clicks send.</p>
                    <br>    
                    <p>Ten o’clock that night, while sharing a pint at Chequers, both of them realise this friendly meet-up had become somewhat of an unofficial date and that they were destined to be more than just work colleagues or friends.</p>
